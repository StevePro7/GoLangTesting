A lot of independently executing things
independent agents

concurrency:
writing or structuring to deal with the real world

definition of concurrency
composition of independently executing computations [goroutines]

a way to structure software to write clean code that interacts well with real world

concurrency is NOT parallelism although is enables parallelism

one processor: program can be concurrent but it cannot be parallel
well-written concurrent program may run efficiently in parallel on multiprocessor


Concurrency is a model for software construction
- easy to understand
- easy to use
- easy to reason about
- nicer than dealing with parallelism	[threads, semaphores, locks, barriers]

Go don't talk to a process but a channel


CODE

goroutine
launching a shell command with &

goroutine
independently executing function
launched by go statement
has its own stack	grows / shrinks
very cheap		[think cheap thread]
NOT a thread
may be 1x thread with 000s goroutines
goroutines multiplexed dynamically onto threads created as needed


communication
channel in Go provides a connectio between two goroutines
allowing them to communicate


direction
arrow points in the direction in which the channel is sending data

c <- 1		send	1 is pointing into the channel
value = <-c	recd 	arrow is point out of the channel


synchronization
function executes <-c		it will wait for value to be send
function executes c <- value	it waits for receiver to be ready

sender + receiver must both be ready to play part in communcation
otherwise we wait until they are	[can deadlock otherwise]

channels both communicate and synchronize

when you read from a channel you have to wait for a value to be there
it's a blocking operation

when you send a value on a channel, the channel blocks until someone is ready to receive it
it's a blocking operation

channels communicate and synchronize in a single operation
